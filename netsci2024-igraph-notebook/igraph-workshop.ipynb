    "$ pip install igraph\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the core of `igraph` is implemented in C and C++, the Python Package Index hosts pre-compiled binaries for most platforms, so the command above should just work on the vast majority of systems. If you are experiencing problems with the installation or you do not want to install `igraph` on your computer yet, you can also try it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) by opening a new notebook and typing:\n",

    "What happened here? Earlier, we mentioned that igraph uses nmeric identifiers to refer to vertices and edges, and here we were using _names_ instead. This is possible because all igraph functions that accept numeric vertex identifiers also accept _strings_ instead, and whenever a string is encountered, it is treated as a (most likely unique) name of the vertex and the corresponding vertex ID is looked up automatically behind the scenes. The mapping between vertex names and IDs is stored in a vertex attribute named `\"name\"`, and this attribute is special in the sense that `igraph` maintains a reverse mapping behind the scenes that allows us to look up the index of a vertex given its name in constant time, as if we were using a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when we called `g.add_vertices()` with a list of strings instead of a single number, igraph automatically created that many new vertices and associated the strings as names to the individual vertices. This also made it possible to call `g.add_edges()` with a list consisting of pairs of vertex _names_, and each name was automatically mapped back to the corresponding vertex ID. Deleting or adding vertices will automatically update the mapping so we do not need to be concerned with the numeric IDs any more if we do not want to -- vertex identities are preserved via the names given to them, and using the same name will always refer to the same vertex even if we delete vertices or add new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `igraph` is pretty strict in the sense that numbers are always treated as vertex IDs and strings are always treated as vertex names. If your graph is built from a dataset where vertices have natural, numeric identifiers, these _cannot_ be used as-is -- you need to convert the numeric identifiers to _strings_ instead.\n",

This means that whenever we want to visualise a graph, we have to find a mapping from vertices to coordinates in two- or three-dimensional space first, preferably in a way that is pleasing for the eye. A separate branch of graph theory, namely graph drawing, tries to solve this problem via several graph layout algorithms. `igraph` implements quite a few layout algorithms and is also able to draw them onto the screen or to a PDF, PNG or SVG file. Graph drawing is implemented by separate plotting backends; currently `igraph` supports [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/). If you want to use Cairo, you need to install `pycairo`, while the Matplotlib and Plotly backends require `matplotlib` and `plotly` from PyPI, respectively. `igraph` tries to determine the appropriate plotting backend automatically based on the set of packages installed in your environment, but for the sake of this tutorial we should be explicit and select `matplotlib` by updating igraph's configuration object as follows:"
